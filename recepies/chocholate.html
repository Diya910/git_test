    <ol>
        <li>Roast Cocoa Beans:

            Roast raw cocoa beans in an oven or a specialized cocoa roaster until they develop rich flavors. This step is crucial for enhancing the chocolatey taste</li>
        <li>Remove Shells:

            After roasting, crack the cocoa beans to extract the nibs, then winnow to remove the shells, leaving behind the cocoa nibs.</li>
        <li>Grind Cocoa Nibs:

            Grind the cocoa nibs into a paste using a heavy-duty grinder or food processor. This process releases cocoa butter, resulting in a thick, gritty paste known as chocolate liquor.</li>
        <li>Conching:

            Conching is a prolonged mixing and smoothing process to refine the texture and flavor. It can take hours or even days, depending on the desired outcome.</li>
        <li>Tempering and Molding:

            Temper the chocolate by carefully heating and cooling to create stable crystals. Once tempered, pour the chocolate into molds and allow it to set.</li>
